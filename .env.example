# Optional: Custom conda installation (for academic/lab environments)
# Example: CONDA_PREFIX=/path/to/miniconda3

# Optional: Additional conda directories (space-separated list)
# Directories are mounted to the same path inside the container
# Automatic detection:
#   - Paths with "*env*" are added to CONDA_ENVS_DIRS (for environments)
#   - Paths with "*pkg*" are added to CONDA_PKGS_DIRS (for package cache)
# Example: CONDA_EXTRA_DIRS="/vol/lab/username/.conda/envs /vol/lab/username/conda_envs /vol/lab/username/.conda/pkgs /vol/lab/username/conda_pkgs"

# Optional: System packages to install in Docker container (space-separated)
# Common scientific packages: libopenslide0 libgdal-dev libproj-dev libopencv-dev
# Example: SYSTEM_PACKAGES="libopenslide0 libgdal-dev"

# Optional: Native macOS Build Support
# Enable SSH-based communication from container to macOS host for native builds
# Run ./scripts/setup_macos_ssh.sh to configure SSH keys automatically
ENABLE_MACOS_BUILDS=false

# macOS username for SSH connection (usually your macOS username)
# Default: automatically detected from current user

# Optional: Override host working directory path on macOS
# If not set, assumes same path structure as mounted in container
# Example: HOST_WORKING_DIRECTORY=/Users/username/projects/myproject

# Note: Build commands are now configured per-project
# Create a .env file in each project directory with NATIVE_*_COMMAND variables
# Or use claude-build.json for more complex configurations
# See README.md for examples and setup instructions
